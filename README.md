# Todo App with Productivity Timer

This is a web application that combines a Todo list with a Pomodoro-style productivity timer. It allows users to manage their tasks and work in focused sessions with regular breaks.

## Features

1. **User Login Simulation**
   - Fetch and list users from the `/users` endpoint
   - Allow users to select a name to "log in" (no password required)
   - Store the selected user in the application's state

2. **Todo Management**
   - Fetch todos from the `/todos` endpoint where the `userId` matches the logged-in user
   - Display todos with title and completion status

3. **Productivity Timer**
   - Implement a timer for focused work sessions lasting 15 seconds
   - After a work session, prompt the user to take a 5-second break
   - Suggest a longer break of 10 seconds after every 2 work sessions

4. **Styling and Layout**
   - Create a user-friendly and intuitive UI
   - Ensure the app is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices

5. **Filtering and Editing**
   - Added the filters to view all, completed, or incomplete todos

### Enhanced Features

- **Timer Controls**: Start, pause, and reset the timer. Maintain timer state during navigation.
- **Session Tracking**: Keep count of completed work sessions.
